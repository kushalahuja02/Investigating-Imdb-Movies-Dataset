# Investigating Imdb Movies Dataset

## Introduction
Welcome to my project on exploring the IMDb Movies Dataset. This investigation is designed to provide insightful analytics for those in the entertainment industry as well as movie enthusiasts. The focus is on delving into various movie genres, exploring different attributes, and drawing meaningful comparisons.

## Project Context
Looking to understand what makes a movie profitable and popular? You're in the right place! In this project, I explore and uncover fascinating facts about movies using a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 movie records. This dataset is rich with information such as movie titles, budgets, revenues, casts, directors, taglines, keywords, genres, release dates, and runtimes.

## Objectives
Using this dataset, I aim to answer intriguing questions such as:
- Which movies are the most profitable?
- Who are the top-rated directors
- Which are the top production companies, and what is their share?
- What are the trends in movie popularity across different months and is there any relation between them?
- Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and its revenue?

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive code development and results presentation.
